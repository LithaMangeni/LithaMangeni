## Hi, I'm Litha Mangeni 👋👩‍💻
👩‍🎓 I am a junior entry-level front-end developer, proficient in creating interactive web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with an ongoing journey in honing development skills driven by a goal of becoming a versatile software developer. Seeking to contribute and learn while continuously enhancing in emerging technologies and languages.

👩‍💼 Beyond my technical capabilities, I love pushing myself to do better and to grown in knowledge and skills. I enjoy the exchange of ideas and the opportunity to learn from like-minded individuals. I find great fulfillment in helping and teaching others, whether through group work or one-on-one interactions. 

📚 I love reading **novels, self-help books** and **biographies**. My favourite ones are **The Kite-runner** by *Khaled Hosseini* in the genre of novels, **Atomic habits** by *James Clear* in the genre of personal development and **Can't hurt me** by *David Goggins* in the genre of biography.
